# Steps
1. Initializing the mpu6050.
2. Read the RAW values of accelerometer and gyroscope
3. Convert the RAR values to ‘g’ and ‘dps’ for Accelerometer and Gyroscope respectively.

| REG_GYRO_XOUT_H  | 0x43          | These registers store the most recent gyroscope measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| REG_PWR_MGMT_1   | 0x6B          | This register allows the user to configure the power mode and clock source. It also provides a bit for resetting the entire device, and a bit for disabling the temperature sensor.                                                                                                                           |
| REG_WHO_AM_I     | 0x75          | This register is used to verify the identity of the device. The contents of WHO_AM_I are the upper 6 bits of the MPU-60X0’s 7-bit I2C address. The least significant bit of the MPU-60X0’s I2C address is determined by the value of the AD0 pin. The value of the AD0 pin is not reflected in this register. |
